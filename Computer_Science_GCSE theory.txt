Bus/Star topology:

Bus has a server connected to a main cable(bus) which reaches all devices connecting them to the server

Less cables/ cheaper to install
Easier to add more devices

Data traffic slow down response time
If main cable fails whole network fails
Any device can veiw all data on the cable creating a security risk

Star has a server connected to a hub or switch which reaches all devices on the network
Switch directs information
Hub broadcasts information to all

Fast data transfer because devices dont share wires
If one cable fails other devices are not affected

Requires additional hardware such as central switch/network cables
If the central switch fails the whole network goes down

PAN = Personal area network

LAN = Local area network
operates on a single site such as a school building, hotel or business using their own cabling system
Simple to set up at a low cost and uses high speed connection
Small area

WAN = Wide area network

Advantages and disadvantages of networks:

Computers can share resources such as printers
Files can be accessed from any computer in the network
Data is easy to back-up as it is stroed centrally on the server

Network hardware is expensive
Managing a large network is complicated
Viruses can infiltrate and infect every computer

HTML = Hypertext mark-up language (Coding language for websites)
http/s = hyper text transfer protocal/secure
secure encrypts information to avoid eavesdropping
FTP/s = File transfer protocal/secure
Used for sending/recieving files from FTP server

When an email is sent from a computer it willl first be sent to a mail server using the SMTP protocal
When it reaches the destination the mail is then stored
The user's computer uses POP or IMAP to access the email

SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer protocal

User > Mail Server > Internet > Mail Server > Recipent
    SMTP          SMTP        SMTP      POP/IMAP

POP(Post office protocal) = Will download every new message to your local device and with them no longer being available on the server by default unless changed
Similar to sending a letter through a post office

IMAP(Internet Message Access Protocal) = Keeps messages on the server. Can be accessed by multiple devices and they are removed if the user deletes them

protocal = Set of rules

image file szie

resolution x colour depth = File size in bits

sound file size

hertz = amount of times sound is sampled per second

time(s) x resolution(bits) x hertz = File size in bits

image compression:
Jpeg = lossy
Png = lossless

audio compression:
mp3 = lossy
wav = lossless

Reasons for compression:
save file space 
faster upload
faster download

Trace Tables:
When anything is iterated a new line starts
Follow algorythm provided

OS queues instructions for CPU and how much time it has to run
OS moves data from secondary storage to RAM for the CPU to use
OS allows for multitasking by splitting workloads between CPU cores and choosing which tasks to run
OS manages the IO devices

Interrupts are signals sent by other devices to the CPU to indicate an event needs imediate attention (CPU will suspend current activity to complete)
Hardware interrupts are generated by hardware devices(printer out of paper)
Software interrupts are generated by programs (divideby zero error causes error message to be displayed)
Drivers help devices communicate with eachother (GPU/Printer drivers)

speed:
Registers (volatile)
Cache (volatile)
RAM: Used to store software currently in use (volatile)
ROM (non-volatile) Holds BIOS

BIOS(Basic-Input-Output-System)

CPU has Control unit, Arithmatic logic unit, Registers, cache
ALU: Arithnatic and logical calculations
CU: Handles commands being loaded to CPU and decodes commands and controls data flow through CPU
Registers: Small fast circuits for CPU to store calculations or instructions inside it 

Vonn Newman architecture shows primary storage is need to store programs that are
currently running and need to be accessed by the cpu
