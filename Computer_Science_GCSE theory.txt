PAN = Personal area network
LAN = Local area network
WAN = Wide area network
http/s = hyper text transfer protocal/secure
https = hyper text transfer protocal
protocal = Set of rules


image file szie

resolution x colour depth = File size in bits

sound file size

hertz = amount of times sound is sampled per second

time(s) x resolution(bits) x hertz = File size in bits

image compression:
Jpeg = lossy
Png = lossless

audio compression:
mp3 = lossy
wav = lossless

Reasons for compression:
save file space 
faster upload
faster download


Trace Tables:
When anything is iterated a new line starts
Follow algorythm provided

OS queues instructions for CPU and how much time it has to run
OS moves data from secondary storage to RAM for the CPU to use
OS allows for multitasking by splitting workloads between CPU cores and choosing which tasks to run
OS manages the IO devices

Interrupts are signals sent by other devices to the CPU to indicate an event needs imediate attention (CPU will suspend current activity to complete)
Hardware interrupts are generated by hardware devices(printer out of paper)
Software interrupts are generated by programs (divideby zero error causes error message to be displayed)
Drivers help devices communicate with eachother (GPU/Printer drivers)


speed:
Registers (volatile)
Cache (volatile)
RAM: Used to store software currently in use (volatile)
ROM (non-volatile) Holds BIOS

BIOS(Basic-Input-Output-System)

CPU has Control unit, Arithmatic logic unit, Registers, cache
ALU: Arithnatic and logical calculations
CU: Handles commands being loaded to CPU and decodes commands and controls data flow through CPU
Registers: Small fast circuits for CPU to store calculations or instructions inside it 





Vonn Newman architecture shows primary storage is need to store programs that are
currently running and need to be accessed by the cpu
