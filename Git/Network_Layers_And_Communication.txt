Application layer
encodes/decodes the message in a form that is understood by the sender and the recipient.

Transport layer
breaks down the message into small chunks (packets). Each packet is given a packet number and the total number of packets. The recipient uses this information to assemble the packets together in the correct order. 
It also allows the recipient to see if there are any missing packets.

Network layer
adds the senderâ€™s IP address
and that of the recipient. The network then knows where to send the message, and where it came from.

Link layer
enables the transfer of packets between nodes on a network, and between one network and another.
