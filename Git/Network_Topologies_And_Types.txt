Bus/Star topology:

Bus has a server connected to a main cable(bus) which reaches all devices connecting them to the server

Less cables/ cheaper to install
Easier to add more devices

Data traffic slow down response time
If main cable fails whole network fails
Any device can veiw all data on the cable creating a security risk

Star has a server connected to a hub or switch which reaches all devices on the network
Switch directs information
Hub broadcasts information to all

Fast data transfer because devices dont share wires
If one cable fails other devices are not affected

Requires additional hardware such as central switch/network cables
If the central switch fails the whole network goes down

PAN = Personal area network

LAN = Local area network

WAN = Wide area network

Advantages and disadvantages of networks:


Computers can share resources such as printers
Files can be accessed from any computer in the network
Data is easy to back-up as it is stroed centrally on the server



Network hardware is expensive
Managing a large network is complicated
Viruses can infiltrate and infect every computer
