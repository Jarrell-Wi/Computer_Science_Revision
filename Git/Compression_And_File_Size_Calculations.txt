
image file szie:

resolution x colour depth = File size in bits

sound file size:

hertz = amount of times sound is sampled per second

time(s) x resolution(bits) x hertz = File size in bits

image compression:
Jpeg = lossy
Png = lossless

audio compression:
mp3 = lossy
wav = lossless

Reasons for compression:
save file space 
faster upload
faster download
Less storage intensive
